A Beautiful Soup-based Python web scraper for scraping the USC Classes Webpage: https://classes.usc.edu/term-20231/classes/csci/.
I wrote this script when I wanted to email professors of several different courses to apply for grader/course producer positions.
It creates a CSV with the course code, name, description, and instructor name. 
Additionally, it visits the webpages linked to the instructor name in order to scrape their email addresses.

Command to run: python ClassesScraper.py
